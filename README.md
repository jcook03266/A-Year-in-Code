## A-Year-in-Code | Building Foncii

> The virtual success of this company was comprised of two main goals: to provide consumers like you and me with the most detailed and straightforward experience possible when finding places to eat, and to provide a marketplace for foodie influencers and restaurants to come together and talk business. Foncii's business model operates on four points: the consumer, the restaurant, the influencer, and the platform (us). With all these parties involved, Foncii operates as a self-sustaining platform, allowing regular consumers to explore the culinary landscape of the world without limitation, granting small to large foodie influencers a means of monetizing their brands, and allowing restaurants to gauge tangible metrics of how well influencer marketing campaigns work for their business with concrete data instead of the point and shoot approach that comes with using PR agencies.

## Foncii-API | Development Life Cycle: (February 2023 - May 2024)
**https://api.foncii.com/**
> Foncii's API was built with Node.js and TypeScript. The API itself is a combination of Express.js middleware and Apollo GraphQL. The primary /graphql endpoint served GQL post requests like normal, and some exposed REST endpoints were left in to allow server-to-server communication as well as act as destinations for CRON job triggers. Custom JWT authentication, session management, and other fine-grained access control gateways were integrated into the API to prevent misuse from bad-actors, and to track user activity by identifying each request respectively. Additionally, the API codebase features an SDL generator, such that whenever the schema is updated the SDL can be regenerated by running the generation script. 

The data-layer of the API is server by a dedicated MongoDB cluster, with each connection/instance being pooled by the API's database manager class until all operations are resolved and their respective connections released. To limit response times and cutdown on latency the server uses Apollo's LRU cache to serve repeat requests; a distributed cache (e.g. Redis) wasn't used in this case since the userbase of the product was still very small and this optimization wasn't necessary yet. The server was deployed using Google Compute Engine, namely App Engine Flex to scale both vertically and horizontally as a function of the server's traffic load.
